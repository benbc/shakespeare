Act 1 Scene 1

[Enter Theseus and Hippolyta.]

THESEUS       Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
              Draws on apace. Four happy days bring in
              Another moon. But, O, methinks how slow
              This old moon wanes!

HIPPOLYTA                          Four days will quickly pass;
              Four nights will quickly dream away the time.

THESEUS       Hippolyta, I wooed thee with my sword
              But I will wed thee in another key,
              With pomp, with triumph, and with reveling.

[Enter Egeus, Hermia, Lysander and Demetrius.]

EGEUS         Happy be Theseus, our renownèd duke!

THESEUS       Thanks, good Egeus. What’s the news with thee?

EGEUS         Full of vexation come I, with complaint
              Against my child, my daughter Hermia.

[Egeus points to Demetrius.]

              This man hath my consent to marry her.

[Egeus points to Lysander.]

              This man hath bewitched the bosom of my child.--
              With cunning hast thou filched my daughter’s heart,
              Turned her obedience (which is due to me)
              To stubborn harshness.

THESEUS                              Be advised, fair maid.
              To you, your father should be as a god.
              Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.

HERMIA        So is Lysander.

THESEUS                       In himself he is,
              But in this kind, wanting your father’s voice,
              The other must be held the worthier.

HERMIA        I would my father looked but with my eyes.

THESEUS       Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.

DEMETRIUS     Relent, sweet Hermia, and, Lysander, yield
              Thy crazèd title to my certain right.

LYSANDER      You have her father’s love, Demetrius.
              Let me have Hermia’s. Do you marry him.

EGEUS         Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;
              And what is mine my love shall render him.

LYSANDER      I am, my lord, as well derived as he,
              As well possessed. My love is more than his.
              Demetrius loved Helen and she dotes,
              Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
              Upon this spotted and inconstant man.

THESEUS       I must confess that I have heard so much,
              And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof.
              Come, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?--
              Demetrius and Egeus, go along.
              I must employ you in some business.

EGEUS         With duty and desire we follow you.

[Theseus, Hippolyta, Egeus and Demetrius exit.]

LYSANDER      How now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?
              How chance the roses there do fade so fast?

HERMIA        Belike for want of rain, which I could well
              Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.

LYSANDER      Ay me! For aught that I could ever read,
              Could ever hear by tale or history,
              The course of true love never did run smooth.
              Now listen, love, I have a widow aunt;
              From Athens is her house remote seven leagues.
              There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee.
              Steal forth thy father’s house tomorrow night,
              And in the wood a league without the town
              There will I stay for thee.

HERMIA                                    My good Lysander,
              In that same place thou hast appointed me,
              Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.

LYSANDER      Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.

[Enter Helena.]

HERMIA        Godspeed, fair Helena. Whither away?

HELENA        Call you me "fair"? That "fair" again unsay.
              Demetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!
              O, teach me how you look and with what art
              You sway the motion of Demetrius’ heart!

HERMIA        I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.

HELENA        O, that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!

HERMIA        I give him curses, yet he gives me love.

HELENA        O, that my prayers could such affection move!

HERMIA        The more I hate, the more he follows me.

HELENA        The more I love, the more he hateth me.

HERMIA        His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.

HELENA        None but your beauty. Would that fault were mine!

HERMIA        Take comfort: he no more shall see my face.
              Lysander and myself will fly this place.
              Farewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us,
              And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius.--
              Keep word, Lysander. We must starve our sight
              From lovers’ food till morrow deep midnight.

LYSANDER      I will, my Hermia.

[Hermia exits.]
                                 Helena, adieu.
              As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!

[Lysander exits.]

HELENA        How happy some over other some can be!
              Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
              But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so.
              He will not know what all but he do know.
              I will go tell him of fair Hermia’s flight.
              Then to the wood will he tomorrow night
              Pursue her. And, for this intelligence
              If I have thanks, it is a dear expense.

[Helena exits.]

Act 1 Scene 2

[Enter Quince, Snug, Bottom, Flute, Snout and Starveling.]

QUINCE        Is all our company here?

BOTTOM        You were best to call them generally, man by
              man, according to the script.

QUINCE        Here is the scroll of every man’s name which
              is to play in our interlude before the Duke and the
              Duchess on his wedding day.

BOTTOM        First, good Peter Quince, say what the play
              treats on, then read the names of the actors.

QUINCE        Marry, our play is "The most lamentable comedy and most
              cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe".

BOTTOM        Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the
              scroll.

QUINCE        Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.

BOTTOM        Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.

QUINCE        You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.

BOTTOM        What is Pyramus--a lover or a tyrant?

QUINCE        A lover that kills himself most gallant for love.

BOTTOM        That will ask some tears in the true performing of
              it. If I do it, let the audience look to their eyes. I
              will move storms. Now name the rest of the players.

QUINCE        Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.

FLUTE         Here, Peter Quince.

QUINCE        Flute, you must take Thisbe on you.

FLUTE         What is Thisbe--a wandering knight?

QUINCE        It is the lady that Pyramus must love.

FLUTE         Nay, faith, let not me play a woman. I have a
              beard coming.

QUINCE        That’s all one. You shall play it in a mask, and
              you may speak as small as you will.

BOTTOM        An I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too.
              I’ll speak in a monstrous little voice: "Ah Pyramus,
              my lover dear!"

QUINCE        No, no, you must play Pyramus--and, Flute, you Thisbe.

BOTTOM        Well, proceed.

QUINCE        Robin Starveling, the tailor.

STARVELING    Here, Peter Quince.

QUINCE        Robin Starveling, you must play Thisbe’s
              mother.--Tom Snout, the tinker.

SNOUT         Here, Peter Quince.

QUINCE        You, Pyramus’ father. Snug the joiner, you the lion’s part.

SNUG          Have you the lion’s part written? Pray you, if it
              be, give it me, for I am slow of study.

QUINCE        You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but
              roaring.

BOTTOM        Let me play the lion too. I will roar that I will
              do any man’s heart good to hear me. I will roar that
              I will make the Duke say "Let him roar again. Let
              him roar again!"

QUINCE        You can play no part but Pyramus.

BOTTOM        Well, I will undertake it.

QUINCE        Masters, I am to entreat you, request you, and desire you
              to con your parts by tomorrow night and meet me in the
              palace wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight.
              There will we rehearse. I pray you fail me not.

BOTTOM        We will meet, and there we may rehearse most obscenely
              and courageously. Take pains. Be perfect. Adieu.

[They exit.]

Act 2 Scene 1

[Enter Mustardseed and Puck.]

PUCK          How now, spirit? Whither wander you?

MUSTARDSEED   Over hill, over dale,
              Thorough bush, thorough brier,
              Over park, over pale,
              Thorough flood, thorough fire;
              I do wander everywhere,
              Swifter than the moon’s sphere.
              And I serve the Fairy Queen,
              To dew her orbs upon the green.

PUCK          The King doth keep his revels here tonight.
              Take heed the Queen come not within his sight,
              For Oberon is passing fell and wrath
              Because that she, as her attendant, hath
              A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king;
              She never had so sweet a changeling.
              And jealous Oberon would have the child
              Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild.
              But she perforce withholds the lovèd boy,
              Crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy.

MUSTARDSEED   Either I mistake your shape and making quite,
              Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
              Called Robin Goodfellow. Are not you he
              That frights the maidens of the villagery,
              Are not you he?

PUCK                          Thou speakest aright.
              I am that merry wanderer of the night.
              I jest to Oberon and make him smile
              When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
              Neighing in likeness of a filly foal.
              And sometime lurk I in a gossip’s bowl.
              But room, fairy. Here comes Oberon.

MUSTARDSEED   And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!

[Enter Oberon and Titania.]

OBERON        Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.

TITANIA       What, jealous Oberon? Fairies, skip hence.
              I have forsworn his bed and company.

OBERON        Tarry, rash wanton. Am not I thy lord?

TITANIA       Then I must be thy lady. But, my lord,
              Now never, since the middle summer’s spring,
              Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,
              By pavèd fountain or by rushy brook,
              Or in the beachèd margent of the sea,
              To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,
              But with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport.

OBERON        Do you amend it, then. It lies in you.
              Why should Titania cross her Oberon?
              I do but beg a little changeling boy
              To be my henchman.

TITANIA                          Set your heart at rest:
              The Fairyland buys not the child of me.
              His mother was a votaress of my order,
              And for her sake do I rear up her boy,
              And for her sake I will not part with him.

OBERON        How long within this wood intend you stay?

TITANIA       Perchance till after Theseus’ wedding day.
              If you will patiently dance in our round
              And see our moonlight revels, go with us.
              If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.

OBERON        Give me that boy and I will go with thee.

TITANIA       Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away.
              We shall chide downright if I longer stay.

[Titania and Mustardseed.]

OBERON        Well, go thy way. Thou shalt not from this grove
              Till I torment thee for this injury.--
              My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest
              Since once I sat upon a promontory
              And heard a mermaid singing?

PUCK                                        I remember.

OBERON        That very time I saw (but thou couldst not),
              Flying between the cold moon and the earth,
              Cupid loose his love-shaft from his bow;
              And marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell.
              It fell upon a little western flower:
              Fetch me that flower. The juice on eyelids laid
              Will make or man or woman madly dote
              Upon the next live creature that it sees.
              Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again
              Ere the leviathan can swim a league.

PUCK          I’ll put a girdle round about the Earth
              In forty minutes.

[Puck exits.]

OBERON                          Having once this juice,
              I’ll watch Titania when she is asleep
              And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.
              The next thing then she, waking, looks upon
              She shall pursue it with the soul of love.
              But who comes here? I am invisible,
              And I will overhear their conference.

[Enter Demetrius and Helena following him.]

DEMETRIUS     I love thee not; therefore pursue me not.
              Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
              Thou toldest me they were stolen unto this wood,
              Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.

HELENA        You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant!

DEMETRIUS     Do I entice you? Do I speak you fair?
              Or rather do I not in plainest truth
              Tell you I do not, nor I cannot love you?

HELENA        And even for that do I love you the more.
              I am your spaniel, and, Demetrius,
              The more you beat me I will fawn on you.
              Use me but as your spaniel: spurn me, strike me,

DEMETRIUS     Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit,
              For I am sick when I do look on thee.

HELENA        And I am sick when I look not on you.

DEMETRIUS     I’ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes
              And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.

[Demetrius exits.]

HELENA        I’ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell
              To die upon the hand I love so well.

[Helena exits.]

OBERON        Fare thee well, nymph. Ere he do leave this grove,
              Thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love.
[Enter Puck.]
              Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.

PUCK          Ay, there it is.

OBERON                         I pray thee give it me.

[Puck gives Oberon the flower.]

              I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,
              Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows.
              There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,
              Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight.
              And with the juice of this I’ll streak her eyes
              And make her full of hateful fantasies.
              Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove.

[Oberon gives Puck part of the flower.]

              A sweet Athenian lady is in love
              With a disdainful youth. Anoint his eyes,
              But do it when the next thing he espies
              May be the lady. Meet ere first cock crow.

PUCK          Fear not, my lord. Your servant shall do so.

[They exit.]

Act 2 Scene 2

[Enter Titania, Cobweb, Mustardseed and Peaseblossom.]

TITANIA       Come now, a fairy song: sing me asleep.
              Then to your offices and let me rest.

[She lies down.]

COBWEB        You spotted snakes with double tongue,
              Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen.
              Newts and blindworms, do no wrong,
              Come not near our Fairy Queen.

MUSTARDSEED   Weaving spiders, come not here.
              Hence, you long-legged spinners, hence.
              Beetles black, approach not near.
              Worm nor snail, do no offence.

[Titania sleeps.]

PEASEBLOSSOM  Hence, away! Now all is well.
              One aloof stand sentinel.

[Fairies exit. Enter Oberon, who anoints Titania’s eyelids
with the flower.]

OBERON        What thou seest when thou dost wake,
              Do it for thy true love take.
              When thou wakest, it is thy dear.
              Wake when some vile thing is near.

[Oberon exits. Enter Lysander and Hermia.]

LYSANDER      Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood.
              And, to speak troth, I have forgot our way.
              We’ll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,
              And tarry for the comfort of the day.

HERMIA        Be it so, Lysander. Find you out a bed,
              For I upon this bank will rest my head.

LYSANDER      Here is my bed. Sleep give thee all his rest!

HERMIA        With half that wish the wisher’s eyes be pressed!

[Lysander and Hermia sleep. Enter Puck.]

PUCK          Through the forest have I gone,
              But Athenian found I none

[Puck sees Lysander.]

              Night and silence! Who is here?
              Weeds of Athens he doth wear.

[Puck anoints Lysander’s eyelids with the flower.]

              When thou wakest, let love forbid
              Sleep his seat on thy eyelid.
              So, awake when I am gone,
              For I must now to Oberon.

[Puck exits. Enter Demetrius and Helena.]

HELENA        Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.

DEMETRIUS     I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.

HELENA        O, wilt thou darkling leave me? Do not so.

DEMETRIUS     Stay, on thy peril. I alone will go.

[Demetrius exits.]

HELENA        O, O! I am as ugly as a bear,
              For beasts that meet me run away for fear.
              Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
              Do as a monster fly my presence thus.
              But who is here? Lysander, on the ground!
              Dead or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.--
              Lysander, if you live, good sir, awake.

[Lysander wakes up.]

LYSANDER      And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.
              Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word
              Is that vile name to perish on my sword!

HELENA        Do not say so. Lysander, say not so.
              What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?
              Yet Hermia still loves you. Then be content.

LYSANDER      Content with Hermia? No, I do repent
              The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
              Not Hermia, but Helena I love.
              Who will not change a raven for a dove?

HELENA        Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
              When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
              Is it not enough, is it not enough, young man,
              That I did never, no, nor never can
              Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius’ eye,
              But you must flout my insufficiency?
              But fare you well. Perforce I must confess
              I thought you lord of more true gentleness.

[Helena exits.]

LYSANDER      She sees not Hermia.--Hermia, sleep thou there,
              And never mayst thou come Lysander near.
              And, all my powers, address your love and might
              To honor Helen and to be her knight.

[Lysander exits. Hermia wakes up.]

HERMIA        Lysander! What, removed? Lysander, lord!
              What, out of hearing? Gone? No sound, no word?
              O! Now I well perceive you are not nigh.
              Either death or you I’ll find immediately.

[Hermia exits.]

Act 3 Scene 1

[Enter Bottom, Quince, Snout, Starveling, Snug, and Flute.]

BOTTOM        Are we all met?

QUINCE        Pat, pat. And here’s a marvellous convenient
              place for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be
              our stage.

              Now, masters, there is one hard thing: we must have a
              wall in the great chamber, for Pyramus and Thisbe,
              says the story, did talk through the chink of a wall.

SNOUT         You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?

BOTTOM        Some man or other must present Wall. And let him have
              some plaster, or some loam, or some roughcast about him
              to signify wall, or let him hold his fingers thus, and
              through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper.

QUINCE        If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down, every
              mother’s son, and rehearse your parts. Pyramus, you
              begin. When you have spoken your speech, enter into that
              brake, and so everyone according to his cue.

[Enter Puck invisible to those onstage.]

PUCK          What hempen homespuns have we swaggering here
              So near the cradle of the Fairy Queen?

QUINCE        Speak, Pyramus.--Thisbe, stand forth.

BOTTOM        [As Pyramus] Thisbe, the flowers of odours savors sweet--
              So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisbe dear.--
              But hark, a voice! Stay thou but here awhile,
              And by and by I will to thee appear.

[Bottom exits.]

PUCK          A stranger Pyramus than ever played here.

[Puck exits.]

FLUTE         Must I speak now?

QUINCE        Ay, marry, must you, for you must understand he goes but
              to see a noise that he heard and is to come again.

FLUTE         [As Thisbe] Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,
              Of color like the red rose on triumphant brier,
              Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew,
              As true as truest horse, that yet would never tire.

[Enter Bottom with an ass's head.]

BOTTOM        [As Bottom] If I were fair, fair Thisbe, I were only thine.

QUINCE        O monstrous! O strange! We are haunted. Pray,
              masters, fly, masters! Help!

[Quince, Flute, Snout, Snug, and Starveling exit.]

BOTTOM        Why do they run away? This is a knavery of
              them to make me afeard. But I will not stir from
              this place. I will walk up and down here, and I will
              sing, that they shall hear I am not afraid.

              The ouzel cock, so black of hue,
              With orange-tawny bill,
              The throstle with his note so true,
              The wren with little quill--

[Titania wakes up.]

TITANIA       What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?
              I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again.
              Mine ear is much enamored of thy note,
              So is mine eye enthrallèd to thy shape,
              And thy fair virtue’s force perforce doth move me
              On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.

BOTTOM        Methinks, mistress, you should have little
              reason for that.

TITANIA       Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.
              Out of this wood do not desire to go.
              Thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no,
              For I do love thee. Therefore go with me.
              I’ll give thee fairies to attend on thee,
              Peaseblossom, Cobweb, come; and Mustardseed!

[Enter Peaseblossom, Cobweb, and Mustardseed.]

PEASEBLOSSOM  Ready.

COBWEB        And I.

MUSTARDSEED   And I.

TITANIA       Be kind and courteous to this gentleman.
              Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;
              Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.

PEASEBLOSSOM  Hail, mortal!

COBWEB        Hail!

MUSTARDSEED   Hail!

BOTTOM        I cry your Worships mercy, heartily.--I beseech
              your Worship’s names.

COBWEB        Cobweb.

PEASEBLOSSOM  Peaseblossom.

MUSTARDSEED   Mustardseed.

TITANIA       Come, wait upon him. Lead him to my bower.
              Tie up my lover’s tongue. Bring him silently.

[They exit.]

Act 3 Scene 2

[Enter Oberon.]

OBERON        I wonder if Titania be awaked;
              Then what it was that next came in her eye,
              Which she must dote on in extremity.

[Enter Puck.]

              Here comes my messenger. How now, mad spirit?

PUCK          My mistress with a monster is in love.
              While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
              A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
              Were met together to rehearse a play.
              One left his scene and entered in a brake,
              Where I an ass's noll fixed on his head.
              When in that moment, so it came to pass,
              Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.

OBERON        This falls out better than I could devise.
              But hast thou yet latched the Athenian’s eyes
              With the love juice, as I did bid thee do?

PUCK          I took him sleeping--that is finished, too.

[Enter Demetrius and Hermia.]

OBERON        Stand close. This is the same Athenian.

PUCK          This is the woman, but not this the man.

[Oberon and Puck step aside.]

DEMETRIUS     O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
              Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe!

HERMIA        Now I but chide, but I should use thee worse,
              For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse.
              Where is my dear Lysander? Where is he?
              Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?

DEMETRIUS     I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.

HERMIA        Out, dog! Out, cur! Thou drivest me past the bounds
              Of maiden’s patience. Hast thou slain him, then?
              Henceforth be never numbered among men.

DEMETRIUS     You spend your passion on a misprised mood.
              I am not guilty of Lysander’s blood,

HERMIA        Now from thy hated presence part I so.
              See me no more, whether he be dead or no.

[Hermia exits.]

DEMETRIUS     There is no following her in this fierce vein.
              Here, therefore, for a while I will remain.

[Demetrius lies down and falls asleep.]

OBERON        What hast thou done? Thou hast mistaken quite
              And laid the love juice on some true-love’s sight.
              About the wood go swifter than the wind,
              And Helena of Athens look thou find.
              By some illusion see thou bring her here.
              I’ll charm his eyes against she do appear.

PUCK          I go, I go, look how I go,
              Swifter than arrow from the Tartar’s bow.

[Puck exits. Oberon annoints Demetrius' eyes with the flower.]

OBERON        Flower of this purple dye,
              Hit with Cupid’s archery.

[Enter Puck.]

PUCK          Captain of our fairy band,
              Helena is here at hand,
              And the youth, mistook by me.
              Lord, what fools these mortals be!

OBERON        Stand aside. The noise they make
              Will cause Demetrius to awake.

[Oberon and Puck step aside. Enter Lysander and Helena.]

LYSANDER      Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?

HELENA        You do advance your cunning more and more.
              These vows are Hermia’s. Will you give her over?

LYSANDER      I had no judgment when to her I swore.

HELENA        Nor none, in my mind, now you give her over.

LYSANDER      Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.

[Demetrius wakes up.]

DEMETRIUS     O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!
              To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?

HELENA        O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent
              To set against me for your merriment.
              Can you not hate me, as I know you do,
              But you must join in souls to mock me too?
              You both are rivals and love Hermia,
              And now both rivals to mock Helena.

LYSANDER      You are unkind, Demetrius. Be not so,
              For you love Hermia; this you know I know.

HELENA        Never did mockers waste more idle breath.

DEMETRIUS     Lysander, keep thy Hermia. I will none.
              If ever I loved her, all that love is gone.

[Enter Hermia.]

HERMIA        Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;
              Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound.
              But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?

LYSANDER      Why should he stay whom love doth press to go?

HERMIA        What love could press Lysander from my side?

LYSANDER      Lysander’s love, that would not let him bide,
              Fair Helena, who more engilds the night
              Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.
              Why seekest thou me? Could not this make thee know
              The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?

HERMIA        You speak not as you think. It cannot be.

HELENA        Now I perceive they have conjoined all three
              To fashion this false sport in spite of me.--
              Injurious Hermia, most ungrateful maid,
              Have you conspired, have you with these contrived,
              To bait me with this foul derision?

HERMIA        I scorn you not. It seems that you scorn me.
              If you have any pity, grace, or manners,
              You would not make me such an argument.
              But fare you well. ’Tis partly my own fault,
              Which death or absence soon shall remedy.

LYSANDER      Stay, gentle Helena. Hear my excuse,
              My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena.

HELENA        O excellent!

HERMIA                     Sweet, do not scorn her so.

[Hermia holds Lysander.]

LYSANDER      Helen, I love thee. By my life, I do.
              Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! Vile thing, let loose,
              Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent.

[Hermia turns Lysander loose.]

HERMIA        O me! [ To Helena.]  You juggler, you cankerblossom,
              You thief of love! What, have you come by night
              And stolen my love’s heart from him?

HELENA                                             Fine, i’ faith.
              Have you no modesty, no maiden shame?
              Fie, fie, you counterfeit, you puppet, you!

HERMIA        "Puppet"? Why so? Ay, that way goes the game.
              She urged her height and with her personage,
              Her height, forsooth, she hath prevailed with him.
              How low am I, thou painted maypole? Speak!
              How low am I? I am not yet so low
              But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.

HELENA        I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,
              Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,
              Because she is something lower than myself,
              That I can match her.

HERMIA                              "Lower"? Hark, again!

LYSANDER      Be not afraid. She shall not harm thee, Helena.

DEMETRIUS     No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.

HELENA        O, though she be but little, she is fierce.

[Hermia attacks Helena but Demetrius and Lysander stop her.]

HERMIA        "Little" again? Nothing but "low" and "little"?
              Let me come to her.

LYSANDER                          Get you gone, you dwarf,
              You minimus of hindering knotgrass made,
              You bead, you acorn--

DEMETRIUS                          You are too officious
              In her behalf that scorns your services.
              Let her alone. Speak not of Helena.

LYSANDER      Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right,
              Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.

DEMETRIUS     "Follow"? Nay, I’ll go with thee, cheek by jowl.

[Demetrius and Lysander exit.]

HERMIA        You, mistress, all this coil is long of you.

HELENA        Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray.
              My legs are longer though, to run away.

[She exits.]

HERMIA        I am amazed and know not what to say.

[She exits.]

OBERON        This is thy negligence. Still thou mistakest,
              Or else committest thy knaveries willfully.

PUCK          Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.
              Did not you tell me I should know the man
              By the Athenian garments he had on?

OBERON        Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight.
              Hie, therefore, Robin, overcast the night;
              Then crush this herb into Lysander’s eye,

[Oberon gives a flower to Puck.]

              Whose liquor hath this virtuous property:
              That when they wake, all this derision
              Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision.
              Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,
              I’ll to my queen and beg her Indian boy.

[Oberon exits.]

PUCK          Up and down, up and down,
              I will lead them up and down.
              I am feared in field and town.
              Goblin, lead them up and down.

[Enter Lysander.]

LYSANDER      Where art thou, proud Demetrius? Speak thou now.

[Lysander exits. Enter Demetrius.]

DEMETRIUS     Lysander, speak again.
              Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?

[Demetrius exits. Enter Lysander.]

LYSANDER      Now fallen am I in dark uneven way,
              And here will rest me. Come, thou gentle day.

[Lysander lies down and sleeps. Enter Demetrius.]

DEMETRIUS     Now am I lost. Faintness constraineth me
              To measure out my length on this cold bed.
              By day’s approach look to be visited.

[Demetrius lies down and sleeps Enter Helena.]

HELENA        O weary night, O long and tedious night.
              I shall go back to Athens by daylight.
              Now sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow’s eye,
              Steal me awhile from mine own company.

[Helena lies down and sleeps.]

PUCK          Yet but three? Come one more.
              Two of both kinds makes up four.
              Here she comes, curst and sad.
              Cupid is a knavish lad
              Thus to make poor females mad.

[Enter Hermia.]

HERMIA        Never so weary, never so in woe,
              I can no further crawl, no further go.
              Here will I rest me till the break of day.
              Heavens shield Lysander if they mean a fray!

[Hermia lies down and sleeps.]

PUCK          On the ground
              Sleep sound.
              I’ll apply
              To your eye,
              Gentle lover, remedy.

[Puck applies the flower to Lysander’s eyes.]

              When thou wakest,
              Thou takest,
              True delight
              In the sight
              Of thy former lady's eye.

[Puck exits.]

Act 4 Scene 1

[Enter Titania, Bottom, Peaseblossom, Cobweb and Mustardseed.]

TITANIA       Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,
              While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,
              And stick muskroses in thy sleek smooth head,
              And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.

BOTTOM        Where’s Peaseblossom?

PEASEBLOSSOM  Ready.

BOTTOM        Scratch my head, Peaseblossom. Where’s Cobweb?

COBWEB        Ready.

BOTTOM        Cobweb, kill me a red-hipped humble-bee on the top of
              a thistle, and bring me the honey-bag. Where’s Mustardseed?

MUSTARDSEED   What’s your will?

BOTTOM        Nothing, but to help Peaseblossom to scratch. I must
              to the barber’s, for methinks I am marvellous hairy
              about the face. And I am such a tender ass, if my hair
              do but tickle me, I must scratch.

TITANIA       Now say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.

BOTTOM        Truly, a peck of provender. I could munch your good dry
              oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of
              hay. Good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.

BOTTOM        I pray you, let none of your people stir me; I have an
              exposition of sleep come upon me.

TITANIA       Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.--
              Fairies, begone, and be all ways away.

[Peaseblossom, Mustardseed and Cobweb exit.]

              O, how I love thee! How I dote on thee!

[Bottom and Titania sleep. Enter Oberon and Puck.]

OBERON        Welcome, good Robin. Seest thou this sweet sight?
              Her dotage now I pity. I'll undo
              This hateful imperfection of her eyes.

[Oberon applies the flower to her eyes.]

              Be as thou wast wont to be.
              See as thou wast wont to see.

              Now, my Titania, wake you, my sweet queen.

TITANIA       My Oberon, what visions have I seen!
              Methought I was enamored of an ass.

OBERON        There lies your love.

TITANIA                             How came these things to pass?
              O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!

OBERON        Silence awhile.--Robin, take off this head.

[Puck takes off the ass's head.]

PUCK          Now, when thou wakest, with thine own fool’s eyes peep.

              Fairy king, attend and mark.
              I do hear the morning lark.

TITANIA       Come, my lord, and in our flight
              Tell me how it came this night
              That I sleeping here was found
              With these mortals on the ground.

[Oberon, Titania and Puck exit. Helen wakes and sees the others.]

HELEN         I wonder at our being here together.

[Hermia wakes.]

HERMIA        Last night seems small and undistinguishable,
              Like far-off mountains turnèd into clouds.

[Lysander wakes.]

LYSANDER      I am half sleeping, half awake, and swear,
              I cannot truly say how I came here.

[Demetrius wakes.]

DEMETRIUS     O my dear friends! I wot not by what power,
              My love to Hermia's melted as the snow.
              And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
              The object of mine eye is only Helen.
              And I'll for ever more be true to her.

HERMIA        Methinks I see these things with parted eye,
              When everything seems double.

HELENA                                      So methinks.
              And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,
              Mine own and not mine own.

DEMETRIUS                                Are you sure
              That we are awake? It seems to me
              That yet we sleep, we dream.

LYSANDER                                   Let us to Athens,
              And by the way let us recount our dreams.

[Hermia, Helena, Demetrius and Lysander exit.]

BOTTOM        Hey-ho! Peter Quince! Flute the bellows-mender!
              Snout the tinker! Starveling! God’s my life! Stolen
              hence and left me asleep! I have had a most rare
              vision. I have had a dream past the wit of man to say
              what dream it was. Methought I was--there
              is no man can tell what. Methought I was and
              methought I had--but man is but a patched fool if
              he will offer to say what methought I had.

[Enter Quince, Flute, Snout, and Starveling.]

BOTTOM        Where are these lads? Where are these hearts?

QUINCE        Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!

BOTTOM        Masters, I am to discourse wonders. But ask me not what;
              for, if I tell you, I am not true Athenian. I will tell
              you everything right as it fell out.

[Enter Snug.]

SNUG          Masters, the Duke is coming from the temple, and there
              is two or three lords and ladies more married.

BOTTOM        Get your apparel together, Meet presently at the palace.
              Every man look over his part. Let Thisbe have clean
              linen, and let not him that plays the lion pare his
              nails, for they shall hang out for the lion’s claws. No
              more words. Away! Go, away!

[Bottom, Quince, Flute, Snout, Starveling and Snug exit.]

Act 5 Scene 1

[Enter Theseus and Hippolyta.]

HIPPOLYTA     ’Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.

THESEUS       More strange than true. I never may believe
              These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
              Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
              Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend
              More than cool reason ever comprehends.

HIPPOLYTA     But all the story of the night told over,
              And all their minds transfigured so together,
              More witnesseth than fancy’s images
              And grows to something of great constancy,
              But, howsoever, strange and admirable.

THESEUS       Come now, what masques, what dances shall we have
              To wear away this long age of three hours
              Between our after-supper and bedtime?

HIPPOLYTA     A play there is, my lord, a tragedy.

THESEUS       Go, bring them in--and take your place, my lady.

[Hippolyta brings in Quince, Bottom, Snout, Snug, Flute and
Starveling. Theseus and Hippolyta sit.]

QUINCE        This man is Pyramus, if you would know.
              This beauteous lady Thisbe is certain.
              This man with lime and roughcast doth present
              "Wall," that vile wall which did these lovers sunder.
              This man presenteth "Moonshine"; you should know,
              By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
              To meet at Ninus’ tomb, there, there to woo.
              This grisly Lion did Thisbe scare away,
              And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,
              Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
              Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
              And finds his trusty Thisbe’s mantle slain.
              Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
              He bravely broached his boiling bloody breast.
              And Thisbe, tarrying in mulberry shade,
              His dagger drew, and died. That's all the tale.

SNOUT         In this same interlude it doth befall
              That I, one Snout by name, present a Wall;
              And such a wall as I would have you think
              That had in it a crannied hole or chink.
              This loam, this roughcast, and this stone doth show
              That I am that same Wall. The truth is so.
              And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
              Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.

BOTTOM        O grim-looked night! O night with hue so black!
              O night, which ever art when day is not!
              O night! O night! Alack, alack, alack!
              I fear my Thisbe’s promise is forgot.
              And thou, O Wall, O sweet, O lovely Wall,
              Show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne.
              Thanks, courteous Wall. Jove shield thee well for this.
              But what see I? No Thisbe do I see.
              O wicked Wall, through whom I see no bliss,
              Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!

FLUTE         O Wall, full often hast thou heard my moans
              For parting my fair Pyramus and me.

BOTTOM        I see a voice! Now will I to the chink
              To spy an I can hear my Thisbe’s face.
              Thisbe?

FLUTE                 My love! Thou art my love, I think.

BOTTOM        Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover’s grace.
              O kiss me through the hole of this vile Wall.

FLUTE         I kiss the Wall’s hole, not your lips at all.

BOTTOM        Wilt thou at Ninny’s tomb meet me straightway?

FLUTE         ’Tide life, ’tide death, I come without delay.

[Bottom and Flute exit.]

SNOUT         Thus have I, Wall, my part dischargèd so,
              And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.

[Snout exits.]

SNUG          You ladies, you whose gentle hearts do fear
              The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,
              May now perchance both quake and tremble here,
              When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.
              Then know that I, as Snug the joiner, am
              A lion fell, nor else no lion’s dam.

STARVELING    This lantern doth the hornèd moon present.
              Myself the man in the moon do seem to be.

[Enter Flute.]

FLUTE         This is old Ninny’s tomb. Where is my love?

SNUG          Roar!

[Flute runs off, dropping his mantle. Snug shakes the
mantle in his mouth and then runs off. Enter Bottom.]

BOTTOM        Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams.
              I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright,
              For by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,
              I trust to take of truest Thisbe sight.--

              But stay! O spite!
              But mark, poor knight,
              What dreadful dole is here!
              Eyes, do you see!
              How can it be!
              O dainty duck! O dear!
              Thy mantle good--
              What, stained with blood?
              Approach, ye Furies fell!
              O Fates, come, come,
              Cut thread and thrum,
              Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!

              O, wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame,
              Since lion vile hath here deflowered my dear,
              Which is--no, no--which was the fairest dame
              That lived, that loved, that liked, that looked with cheer?

              Come, tears, confound!
              Out, sword, and wound
              The pap of Pyramus;
              Ay, that left pap,
              Where heart doth hop.

[Bottom stabs himself.]

              Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.
              Now am I dead;
              Now am I fled;
              My soul is in the sky.
              Tongue, lose thy light!
              Moon, take thy flight!
              Now die, die, die, die, die.

[Bottom dies. Enter Flute.]

FLUTE         Asleep, my love?
              What, dead, my dove?
              O Pyramus, arise!
              Speak, speak. Quite dumb?
              Dead? Dead? A tomb
              Must cover thy sweet eyes.
              Tongue, not a word!
              Come, trusty sword,
              Come, blade, my breast imbrue!

[Flute stabs himself.]

              And farewell, friends.
              Thus Thisbe ends.
              Adieu, adieu, adieu.

[Flute dies. Bottom and Flute arise. Applause. The other actors return
and bow.]

BOTTOM        Will it please you to see the Epilogue or to hear a
              Bergomask dance?

THESEUS       No epilogue, I pray you. For your play needs
              no excuse. For when the players are all dead, there need
              none to be blamed. But, come, your Bergomask.

[Dance. Then Bottom, Quince, Flute, Snug, Snout and Starveling exit.]

              The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve.
              My love, to bed! ’Tis almost fairy time.
              I fear we shall outsleep the coming morn
              As much as we this night have overwatched.

[Enter Puck.]

PUCK          Now the hungry lion roars,
              And the wolf behowls the moon,
              Whilst the heavy plowman snores,
              All with weary task fordone.
              And we fairies, that do run
              By the triple Hecate’s team
              From the presence of the sun,
              Following darkness like a dream,
              Now are frolic. Not a mouse
              Shall disturb this hallowed house.

[Enter Oberon, Titania and Puck.]

OBERON        Through the house give glimmering light,
              By the dead and drowsy fire.
              Every elf and fairy sprite,
              Hop as light as bird from brier.

TITANIA       Now, until the break of day,
              Through this house each fairy stray.
              To the best bride-bed will we,
              Which by us shall blessèd be,
              And the issue there create
              Ever shall be fortunate.
              So shall all the couples three
              Ever true in loving be.

OBERON        Trip away. Make no stay.
              Meet me all by break of day.

[Oberon and Titania exit.]

PUCK          If we shadows have offended,
              Think but this and all is mended:
              That you have but slumbered here
              While these visions did appear.
              And, as I am an honest Puck,
              If we have unearnèd luck
              Now to escape the serpent’s tongue,
              We will make amends ere long.
              Else the Puck a liar call.
              So good night unto you all.
              Give me your hands, if we be friends,
              And Robin shall restore amends.

[Puck exits.]
