<stage>Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, and Philostrate, with others.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour</line>
<line>Draws on apace. Four happy days bring in</line>
<line>Another moon. But, O, methinks how slow</line>
<line>This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires</line>
<line>Like to a stepdame or a dowager</line>
<line>Long withering out a young man&#8217;s revenue.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;</line>
<line>Four nights will quickly dream away the time;</line>
<line>And then the moon, like to a silver bow</line>
<line>New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night</line>
<line>Of our solemnities.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<ab>
<line cont="true">Go, Philostrate,</line>
<line>Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments.</line>
<line>Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth.</line>
<line>Turn melancholy forth to funerals;</line>
<line>The pale companion is not for our pomp.</line>
<stage>Philostrate exits.</stage>
<line>Hippolyta, I wooed thee with my sword</line>
<line>And won thy love doing thee injuries,</line>
<line>But I will wed thee in another key,</line>
<line>With pomp, with triumph, and with reveling.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Egeus and his daughter Hermia, and Lysander
and Demetrius.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>EGEUS</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Happy be Theseus, our renown&#232;d duke!</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Thanks, good Egeus. What&#8217;s the news with thee?</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EGEUS</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Full of vexation come I, with complaint</line>
<line>Against my child, my daughter Hermia.&#8212;</line>
<line>Stand forth, Demetrius.&#8212;My noble lord,</line>
<line>This man hath my consent to marry her.&#8212;</line>
<line>Stand forth, Lysander.&#8212;And, my gracious duke,</line>
<line>This man hath bewitched the bosom of my child.&#8212;</line>
<line>Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes</line>
<line>And interchanged love tokens with my child.</line>
<line>Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung</line>
<line>With feigning voice verses of feigning love</line>
<line>And stol&#8217;n the impression of her fantasy</line>
<line>With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits,</line>
<line>Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats&#8212;messengers</line>
<line>Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth.</line>
<line>With cunning hast thou filched my daughter&#8217;s heart,</line>
<line>Turned her obedience (which is due to me)</line>
<line>To stubborn harshness.&#8212;And, my gracious duke,</line>
<line>Be it so she will not here before your Grace</line>
<line>Consent to marry with Demetrius,</line>
<line>I beg the ancient privilege of Athens:</line>
<line>As she is mine, I may dispose of her,</line>
<line>Which shall be either to this gentleman</line>
<line>Or to her death, according to our law</line>
<line>Immediately provided in that case.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<ab>
<line>What say you, Hermia? Be advised, fair maid.</line>
<line>To you, your father should be as a god,</line>
<line>One that composed your beauties, yea, and one</line>
<line>To whom you are but as a form in wax</line>
<line>By him imprinted, and within his power</line>
<line>To leave the figure or disfigure it.</line>
<line>Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>So is Lysander.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<ab>
<line cont="true">In himself he is,</line>
<line>But in this kind, wanting your father&#8217;s voice,</line>
<line>The other must be held the worthier.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>I would my father looked but with my eyes.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.</line>
<line>I know not by what power I am made bold,</line>
<line>Nor how it may concern my modesty</line>
<line>In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;</line>
<line>But I beseech your Grace that I may know</line>
<line>The worst that may befall me in this case</line>
<line>If I refuse to wed Demetrius.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Either to die the death, or to abjure</line>
<line>Forever the society of men.</line>
<line>Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,</line>
<line>Know of your youth, examine well your blood,</line>
<line>Whether (if you yield not to your father&#8217;s choice)</line>
<line>You can endure the livery of a nun,</line>
<line>For aye to be in shady cloister mewed,</line>
<line>To live a barren sister all your life,</line>
<line>Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.</line>
<line>Thrice-bless&#232;d they that master so their blood</line>
<line>To undergo such maiden pilgrimage,</line>
<line>But earthlier happy is the rose distilled</line>
<line>Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn,</line>
<line>Grows, lives, and dies in single blessedness.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,</line>
<line>Ere I will yield my virgin patent up</line>
<line>Unto his lordship whose unwish&#232;d yoke</line>
<line>My soul consents not to give sovereignty.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Take time to pause, and by the next new moon</line>
<line>(The sealing day betwixt my love and me</line>
<line>For everlasting bond of fellowship),</line>
<line>Upon that day either prepare to die</line>
<line>For disobedience to your father&#8217;s will,</line>
<line>Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,</line>
<line>Or on Diana&#8217;s altar to protest</line>
<line>For aye austerity and single life.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Relent, sweet Hermia, and, Lysander, yield</line>
<line>Thy craz&#232;d title to my certain right.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<ab>
<line>You have her father&#8217;s love, Demetrius.</line>
<line>Let me have Hermia&#8217;s. Do you marry him.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EGEUS</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;</line>
<line>And what is mine my love shall render him.</line>
<line>And she is mine, and all my right of her</line>
<line>I do estate unto Demetrius.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<stage>, to Theseus</stage>
<ab>
<line>I am, my lord, as well derived as he,</line>
<line>As well possessed. My love is more than his;</line>
<line>My fortunes every way as fairly ranked</line>
<line>(If not with vantage) as Demetrius&#8217;;</line>
<line>And (which is more than all these boasts can be)</line>
<line>I am beloved of beauteous Hermia.</line>
<line>Why should not I then prosecute my right?</line>
<line>Demetrius, I&#8217;ll avouch it to his head,</line>
<line>Made love to Nedar&#8217;s daughter, Helena,</line>
<line>And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,</line>
<line>Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,</line>
<line>Upon this spotted and inconstant man.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<ab>
<line>I must confess that I have heard so much,</line>
<line>And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;</line>
<line>But, being overfull of self-affairs,</line>
<line>My mind did lose it.&#8212;But, Demetrius, come,</line>
<line>And come, Egeus; you shall go with me.</line>
<line>I have some private schooling for you both.&#8212;</line>
<line>For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself</line>
<line>To fit your fancies to your father&#8217;s will,</line>
<line>Or else the law of Athens yields you up</line>
<line>(Which by no means we may extenuate)</line>
<line>To death or to a vow of single life.&#8212;</line>
<line>Come, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?&#8212;</line>
<line>Demetrius and Egeus, go along.</line>
<line>I must employ you in some business</line>
<line>Against our nuptial, and confer with you</line>
<line>Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>EGEUS</speaker>
<ab>
<line>With duty and desire we follow you.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<stage>All but Hermia and Lysander exit.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<ab>
<line>How now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?</line>
<line>How chance the roses there do fade so fast?</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Belike for want of rain, which I could well</line>
<line>Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Ay me! For aught that I could ever read,</line>
<line>Could ever hear by tale or history,</line>
<line>The course of true love never did run smooth.</line>
<line>But either it was different in blood&#8212;</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>O cross! Too high to be enthralled to low.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Or else misgraff&#232;d in respect of years&#8212;</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>O spite! Too old to be engaged to young.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Or else it stood upon the choice of friends&#8212;</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>O hell, to choose love by another&#8217;s eyes!</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,</line>
<line>War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,</line>
<line>Making it momentany as a sound,</line>
<line>Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,</line>
<line>Brief as the lightning in the collied night,</line>
<line>That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,</line>
<line>And, ere a man hath power to say "Behold!"</line>
<line>The jaws of darkness do devour it up.</line>
<line>So quick bright things come to confusion.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>If then true lovers have been ever crossed,</line>
<line>It stands as an edict in destiny.</line>
<line>Then let us teach our trial patience</line>
<line>Because it is a customary cross,</line>
<line>As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,</line>
<line>Wishes and tears, poor fancy&#8217;s followers.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<ab>
<line>A good persuasion. Therefore, hear me, Hermia:</line>
<line>I have a widow aunt, a dowager</line>
<line>Of great revenue, and she hath no child.</line>
<line>From Athens is her house remote seven leagues,</line>
<line>And she respects me as her only son.</line>
<line>There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;</line>
<line>And to that place the sharp Athenian law</line>
<line>Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me, then</line>
<line>Steal forth thy father&#8217;s house tomorrow night,</line>
<line>And in the wood a league without the town</line>
<line>(Where I did meet thee once with Helena</line>
<line>To do observance to a morn of May),</line>
<line>There will I stay for thee.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line cont="true">My good Lysander,</line>
<line>I swear to thee by Cupid&#8217;s strongest bow,</line>
<line>By his best arrow with the golden head,</line>
<line>By the simplicity of Venus&#8217; doves,</line>
<line>By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,</line>
<line>And by that fire which burned the Carthage queen</line>
<line>When the false Trojan under sail was seen,</line>
<line>By all the vows that ever men have broke</line>
<line>(In number more than ever women spoke),</line>
<line>In that same place thou hast appointed me,</line>
<line>Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Helena.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Godspeed, fair Helena. Whither away?</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Call you me "fair"? That "fair" again unsay.</line>
<line>Demetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!</line>
<line>Your eyes are lodestars and your tongue&#8217;s sweet air</line>
<line>More tunable than lark to shepherd&#8217;s ear</line>
<line>When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.</line>
<line>Sickness is catching. O, were favor so!</line>
<line>Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go.</line>
<line>My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye;</line>
<line>My tongue should catch your tongue&#8217;s sweet melody.</line>
<line>Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,</line>
<line>The rest I&#8217;d give to be to you translated.</line>
<line>O, teach me how you look and with what art</line>
<line>You sway the motion of Demetrius&#8217; heart!</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>O, that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>I give him curses, yet he gives me love.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>O, that my prayers could such affection move!</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>The more I hate, the more he follows me.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>The more I love, the more he hateth me.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>None but your beauty. Would that fault were mine!</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Take comfort: he no more shall see my face.</line>
<line>Lysander and myself will fly this place.</line>
<line>Before the time I did Lysander see</line>
<line>Seemed Athens as a paradise to me.</line>
<line>O, then, what graces in my love do dwell</line>
<line>That he hath turned a heaven unto a hell!</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Helen, to you our minds we will unfold.</line>
<line>Tomorrow night when Phoebe doth behold</line>
<line>Her silver visage in the wat&#8217;ry glass,</line>
<line>Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass</line>
<line>(A time that lovers&#8217; flights doth still conceal),</line>
<line>Through Athens&#8217; gates have we devised to steal.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>And in the wood where often you and I</line>
<line>Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,</line>
<line>Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,</line>
<line>There my Lysander and myself shall meet,</line>
<line>And thence from Athens turn away our eyes</line>
<line>To seek new friends and stranger companies.</line>
<line>Farewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us,</line>
<line>And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius.&#8212;</line>
<line>Keep word, Lysander. We must starve our sight</line>
<line>From lovers&#8217; food till morrow deep midnight.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<ab>
<line>I will, my Hermia.<stage>Hermia exits.</stage>Helena, adieu.</line>
<line>As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<stage>Lysander exits.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>How happy some o&#8217;er other some can be!</line>
<line>Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.</line>
<line>But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so.</line>
<line>He will not know what all but he do know.</line>
<line>And, as he errs, doting on Hermia&#8217;s eyes,</line>
<line>So I, admiring of his qualities.</line>
<line>Things base and vile, holding no quantity,</line>
<line>Love can transpose to form and dignity.</line>
<line>Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind;</line>
<line>And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.</line>
<line>Nor hath Love&#8217;s mind of any judgment taste.</line>
<line>Wings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste.</line>
<line>And therefore is Love said to be a child</line>
<line>Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.</line>
<line>As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,</line>
<line>So the boy Love is perjured everywhere.</line>
<line>For, ere Demetrius looked on Hermia&#8217;s eyne,</line>
<line>He hailed down oaths that he was only mine;</line>
<line>And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,</line>
<line>So he dissolved, and show&#8217;rs of oaths did melt.</line>
<line>I will go tell him of fair Hermia&#8217;s flight.</line>
<line>Then to the wood will he tomorrow night</line>
<line>Pursue her. And, for this intelligence</line>
<line>If I have thanks, it is a dear expense.</line>
<line>But herein mean I to enrich my pain,</line>
<line>To have his sight thither and back again.</line>

<stage>Enter Quince the carpenter, and Snug the joiner, and
Bottom the weaver, and Flute the bellows-mender, and

<speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<ab>
Is all our company here?</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<ab>
You were best to call them generally, man by
man, according to the scrip.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<ab>
Here is the scroll of every man&#8217;s name which
is thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our
interlude before the Duke and the Duchess on his
wedding day at night.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<ab>
First, good Peter Quince, say what the play
treats on, then read the names of the actors, and so
grow to a point.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<ab>
Marry, our play is <title rend="quotes">The most lamentable
comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and
Thisbe.</title>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<ab>
A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a
merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your
actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<ab>
Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<ab>
Ready. Name what part I am for, and
proceed.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<ab>
You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<ab>
What is Pyramus&#8212;a lover or a tyrant?</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<ab>
A lover that kills himself most gallant for love.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<ab>
That will ask some tears in the true performing
of it. If I do it, let the audience look to their
eyes. I will move storms; I will condole in some
measure. To the rest.&#8212;Yet my chief humor is for a
tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a
cat in, to make all split:
<line>The raging rocks</line>
<line>
And shivering shocks</line>
<line>
Shall break the locks</line>
<line>
Of prison gates.</line>
<line>
And Phibbus&#8217; car</line>
<line>
Shall shine from far</line>
<line>
And make and mar</line>
<line>
The foolish Fates.</line>
This was lofty. Now name the rest of the players.
This is Ercles&#8217; vein, a tyrant&#8217;s vein. A lover is more
condoling.</ab>

What is Thisbe&#8212;a wand&#8217;ring knight?</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<ab>
It is the lady that Pyramus must love.</ab>

Nay, faith, let not me play a woman. I have a
beard coming.</ab>
</sp>

That&#8217;s all one. You shall play it in a mask, and
you may speak as small as you will.</ab>
</sp>

<speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<ab>
An I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too.
I&#8217;ll speak in a monstrous little voice: "Thisne,
Thisne!"&#8212;"Ah Pyramus, my lover dear! Thy Thisbe
dear and lady dear!"</ab>

do any man&#8217;s heart good to hear me. I will roar that
I will make the Duke say "Let him roar again. Let
him roar again!"</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<ab>
An you should do it too terribly, you would
fright the Duchess and the ladies that they would
shriek, and that were enough to hang us all.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ALL</speaker>
<ab>
That would hang us, every mother&#8217;s son.</ab>

<sp>
<speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<ab>
I grant you, friends, if you should fright the
ladies out of their wits, they would have no more
discretion but to hang us. But I will aggravate my
voice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking
dove. I will roar you an &#8217;twere any nightingale.</ab>

<speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<ab>
You can play no part but Pyramus, for Pyramus
is a sweet-faced man, a proper man as one

man. Therefore you must needs play
Pyramus.</ab>

Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I
best to play it in?</ab>

Why, what you will.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<ab>
I will discharge it in either your straw-color
beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain
beard, or your French-crown-color beard,
your perfit yellow.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<ab>
Some of your French crowns have no hair at
all, and then you will play barefaced. But, masters,
here are your parts,<stage rend="inline"> giving out the parts,</stage> and I am
to entreat you, request you, and desire you to con
them by tomorrow night and meet me in the palace
wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight. There
will we rehearse, for if we meet in the city, we shall
be dogged with company and our devices known. In
the meantime I will draw a bill of properties such as
our play wants. I pray you fail me not.</ab>
</sp>

We will meet, and there we may rehearse
most obscenely and courageously. Take pains. Be
perfit. Adieu.</ab>

<stage>Enter a Fairy at one door and Robin Goodfellow at
another.</stage>

<speaker>ROBIN</speaker>
<ab>
<line>How now, spirit? Whither wander you?</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>FAIRY</speaker>
<ab>
Over hill, over dale,
Thorough bush, thorough brier,
Over park, over pale,
Thorough flood, thorough fire;
I do wander everywhere,
Swifter than the moon&#8217;s sphere.
And I serve the Fairy Queen,
To dew her orbs upon the green.
The cowslips tall her pensioners be;
In their gold coats spots you see;
Those be rubies, fairy favors;
In those freckles live their savors.
<line>I must go seek some dewdrops here</line>
<line>And hang a pearl in every cowslip&#8217;s ear.</line>
<line>Farewell, thou lob of spirits. I&#8217;ll be gone.</line>
<line>Our queen and all her elves come here anon.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROBIN</speaker>
<ab>
<line>The King doth keep his revels here tonight.</line>
<line>Take heed the Queen come not within his sight,</line>
<line>For Oberon is passing fell and wrath</line>
<line>Because that she, as her attendant, hath</line>
<line>A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king;</line>
<line>She never had so sweet a changeling.</line>
<line>And jealous Oberon would have the child</line>
<line>Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild.</line>
<line>But she perforce withholds the lov&#232;d boy,</line>
<line>Crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy.</line>
<line>And now they never meet in grove or green,</line>
<line>By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,</line>
<line>But they do square, that all their elves for fear</line>
<line>Creep into acorn cups and hide them there.</line>

<speaker>FAIRY</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Either I mistake your shape and making quite,</line>
<line>Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite</line>
<line>Called Robin Goodfellow. Are not you he</line>
<line>That frights the maidens of the villagery,</line>
<line>Skim milk, and sometimes labor in the quern</line>
<line>And bootless make the breathless huswife churn,</line>
<line>And sometime make the drink to bear no barm,</line>
<line>Mislead night wanderers, laughing at their harm?</line>
<line>Those that "Hobgoblin" call you, and "sweet Puck,"</line>
<line>You do their work, and they shall have good luck.</line>
<line>Are not you he?</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROBIN</speaker>
<ab>
<line cont="true">Thou speakest aright.</line>
<line>I am that merry wanderer of the night.</line>
<line>I jest to Oberon and make him smile</line>
<line>When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,</line>
<line>Neighing in likeness of a filly foal.</line>
<line>And sometime lurk I in a gossip&#8217;s bowl</line>
<line>In very likeness of a roasted crab,</line>
<line>And, when she drinks, against her lips I bob</line>
<line>And on her withered dewlap pour the ale.</line>
<line>The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,</line>
<line>Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;</line>
<line>Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,</line>
<line>And "Tailor!" cries, and falls into a cough,</line>
<line>And then the whole choir hold their hips and loffe</line>
<line>And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear</line>
<line>A merrier hour was never wasted there.</line>
<line>But room, fairy. Here comes Oberon.</line>

<line>Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>What, jealous Oberon? Fairies, skip hence.</line>
<line>I have forsworn his bed and company.</line>

<speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Tarry, rash wanton. Am not I thy lord?</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Then I must be thy lady. But I know</line>
<line>When thou hast stolen away from Fairyland</line>
<line>And in the shape of Corin sat all day</line>
<line>Playing on pipes of corn and versing love</line>
<line>To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,</line>
<line>Come from the farthest steep of India,</line>
<line>But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,</line>
<line>Your buskined mistress and your warrior love,</line>
<line>To Theseus must be wedded, and you come</line>
<line>To give their bed joy and prosperity?</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<ab>
<line>How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,</line>
<line>Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,</line>
<line>Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?</line>
<line>Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night</line>
<line>From Perigouna, whom he ravish&#232;d,</line>
<line>And make him with fair Aegles break his faith,</line>
<line>With Ariadne and Antiopa?</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>These are the forgeries of jealousy;</line>
<line>And never, since the middle summer&#8217;s spring,</line>
<line>Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,</line>
<line>By pav&#232;d fountain or by rushy brook,</line>
<line>Or in the beach&#232;d margent of the sea,</line>
<line>To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,</line>
<line>But with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport.</line>
<line>Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,</line>
<line>As in revenge have sucked up from the sea</line>
<line>Contagious fogs, which, falling in the land,</line>
<line>Hath every pelting river made so proud</line>
<line>That they have overborne their continents.</line>
<line>The ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain,</line>
<line>The plowman lost his sweat, and the green corn</line>
<line>Hath rotted ere his youth attained a beard.</line>
<line>The fold stands empty in the drown&#232;d field,</line>
<line>And crows are fatted with the murrain flock.</line>
<line>The nine-men&#8217;s-morris is filled up with mud,</line>
<line>And the quaint mazes in the wanton green,</line>
<line>For lack of tread, are undistinguishable.</line>
<line>The human mortals want their winter here.</line>
<line>No night is now with hymn or carol blessed.</line>
<line>Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,</line>
<line>Pale in her anger, washes all the air,</line>
<line>That rheumatic diseases do abound.</line>
<line>And thorough this distemperature we see</line>
<line>The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts</line>
<line>Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,</line>
<line>And on old Hiems&#8217; thin and icy crown</line>
<line>An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds</line>
<line>Is, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer,</line>
<line>The childing autumn, angry winter, change</line>
<line>Their wonted liveries, and the maz&#232;d world</line>
<line>By their increase now knows not which is which.</line>
<line>And this same progeny of evils comes</line>
<line>From our debate, from our dissension;</line>
<line>We are their parents and original.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Do you amend it, then. It lies in you.</line>
<line>Why should Titania cross her Oberon?</line>
<line>I do but beg a little changeling boy</line>
<line>To be my henchman.</line>

<ab>
<line cont="true">Set your heart at rest:</line>
<line>The Fairyland buys not the child of me.</line>
<line>His mother was a vot&#8217;ress of my order,</line>
<line>And in the spic&#232;d Indian air by night</line>
<line>Full often hath she gossiped by my side</line>
<line>And sat with me on Neptune&#8217;s yellow sands,</line>
<line>Marking th&#8217; embark&#232;d traders on the flood,</line>
<line>When we have laughed to see the sails conceive</line>
<line>And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;</line>
<line>Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait,</line>
<line>Following (her womb then rich with my young squire),</line>
<line>Would imitate and sail upon the land</line>
<line>To fetch me trifles and return again,</line>
<line>As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.</line>
<line>But she, being mortal, of that boy did die,</line>
<line>And for her sake do I rear up her boy,</line>
<line>And for her sake I will not part with him.</line>

<line>If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.</line>

<sp>
<speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Well, go thy way. Thou shalt not from this grove</line>
<line>Till I torment thee for this injury.&#8212;</line>
<line>My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememb&#8217;rest</line>
<line>Since once I sat upon a promontory</line>
<line>And heard a mermaid on a dolphin&#8217;s back</line>
<line>Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath</line>
<line>That the rude sea grew civil at her song</line>
<line>And certain stars shot madly from their spheres</line>

<speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<ab>
<line>That very time I saw (but thou couldst not),</line>
<line>Flying between the cold moon and the earth,</line>
<line>Cupid all armed. A certain aim he took</line>
<line>At a fair vestal thron&#232;d by the west,</line>
<line>And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow</line>
<line>As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts.</line>
<line>But I might see young Cupid&#8217;s fiery shaft</line>
<line>Quenched in the chaste beams of the wat&#8217;ry moon,</line>
<line>And the imperial vot&#8217;ress pass&#232;d on</line>
<line>In maiden meditation, fancy-free.</line>
<line>Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell.</line>
<line>It fell upon a little western flower,</line>
<line>Before, milk-white, now purple with love&#8217;s wound,</line>
<line>And maidens call it "love-in-idleness."</line>
<line>Fetch me that flower; the herb I showed thee once.</line>
<line>The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid</line>
<line>Will make or man or woman madly dote</line>
<line>Upon the next live creature that it sees.</line>
<line>Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again</line>
<line>Ere the leviathan can swim a league.</line>
</ab>

<ab>
<line>You do impeach your modesty too much</line>

And, to speak troth, I have forgot our way.</line>
<line>
We&#8217;ll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,</line>
<line>
And tarry for the comfort of the day.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Be it so, Lysander. Find you out a bed,</line>
<line>For I upon this bank will rest my head.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<ab>
<line>One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;</line>
<line>One heart, one bed, two bosoms, and one troth.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Nay, good Lysander. For my sake, my dear,</line>
<line>Lie further off yet. Do not lie so near.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<ab>
<line>O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!</line>
<line>Love takes the meaning in love&#8217;s conference.</line>
<line>I mean that my heart unto yours is knit,</line>
<line>So that but one heart we can make of it;</line>
<line>Two bosoms interchain&#232;d with an oath&#8212;</line>
<line>So then two bosoms and a single troth.</line>
<line>Then by your side no bed-room me deny,</line>
<line>For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Lysander riddles very prettily.</line>
<line>Now much beshrew my manners and my pride</line>
<line>If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.</line>
<line>But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy,</line>
<line>Lie further off in human modesty.</line>
<line>Such separation, as may well be said,</line>
<line>Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid.</line>
<line>So far be distant; and good night, sweet friend.</line>
<line>Thy love ne&#8217;er alter till thy sweet life end!</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<ab>
<line>"Amen, amen" to that fair prayer, say I,</line>
<line>And then end life when I end loyalty!</line>
<line>Here is my bed. Sleep give thee all his rest!</line>

Through the forest have I gone,</line>

On whose eyes I might approve</line>
<line>
This flower&#8217;s force in stirring love.</line>
<stage>He sees Lysander.</stage>
<line>
Night and silence! Who is here?</line>
<line>
Weeds of Athens he doth wear.</line>
<line>
This is he my master said</line>
<line>
Despis&#232;d the Athenian maid.</line>
<line>
And here the maiden, sleeping sound</line>
<line>
On the dank and dirty ground.</line>
<line>
Pretty soul, she durst not lie</line>
<line>
Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.&#8212;</line>
<line>
Churl, upon thy eyes I throw</line>
<line>
All the power this charm doth owe.</line>
<stage>He anoints Lysander&#8217;s eyelids
with the nectar.</stage>
<line>
When thou wak&#8217;st, let love forbid</line>
<line>
Sleep his seat on thy eyelid.</line>
<line>
So, awake when I am gone,</line>
<line>
For I must now to Oberon.</line>

<speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>O, I am out of breath in this fond chase.</line>
<line>The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.</line>
<line>Happy is Hermia, wheresoe&#8217;er she lies,</line>
<line>For she hath bless&#232;d and attractive eyes.</line>
<line>How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears.</line>
<line>If so, my eyes are oftener washed than hers.</line>
<line>No, no, I am as ugly as a bear,</line>
<line>For beasts that meet me run away for fear.</line>
<line>Therefore no marvel though Demetrius</line>
<line>Do as a monster fly my presence thus.</line>
<line>What wicked and dissembling glass of mine</line>
<line>Made me compare with Hermia&#8217;s sphery eyne?</line>
<line>But who is here? Lysander, on the ground!</line>
<line>Dead or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.&#8212;</line>
<line>Lysander, if you live, good sir, awake.</line>

<line>And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.</line>
<line>Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,</line>

<line>Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word</line>
<line>Is that vile name to perish on my sword!</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Do not say so. Lysander, say not so.</line>
<line>What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?</line>
<line>Yet Hermia still loves you. Then be content.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Content with Hermia? No, I do repent</line>
<line>The tedious minutes I with her have spent.</line>
<line>Not Hermia, but Helena I love.</line>
<line>Who will not change a raven for a dove?</line>
<line>The will of man is by his reason swayed,</line>
<line>And reason says you are the worthier maid.</line>
<line>Things growing are not ripe until their season;</line>
<line>So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason.</line>
<line>And touching now the point of human skill,</line>
<line>Reason becomes the marshal to my will</line>
<line>And leads me to your eyes, where I o&#8217;erlook</line>

<line>Is &#8217;t not enough, is &#8217;t not enough, young man,</line>
<line>That I did never, no, nor never can</line>
<line>Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius&#8217; eye,</line>
<line>But you must flout my insufficiency?</line>
<line>Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,</line>
<line>In such disdainful manner me to woo.</line>
<line>But fare you well. Perforce I must confess</line>
<line>I thought you lord of more true gentleness.</line>
<line>O, that a lady of one man refused</line>

<line>She sees not Hermia.&#8212;Hermia, sleep thou there,</line>

<line>For, as a surfeit of the sweetest things</line>
<line>The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,</line>
<line>Or as the heresies that men do leave</line>
<line>Are hated most of those they did deceive,</line>
<line>So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,</line>

<stage>With Titania still asleep onstage, enter the Clowns,
Bottom, Quince, Snout, Starveling, Snug, and Flute.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<ab>
Are we all met?</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<ab>
Pat, pat. And here&#8217;s a marvels convenient
place for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be
our stage, this hawthorn brake our tiring-house,
and we will do it in action as we will do it before
the Duke.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<ab>
Peter Quince?</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<ab>
What sayest thou, bully Bottom?</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<ab>
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus
and Thisbe that will never please. First, Pyramus
must draw a sword to kill himself, which the ladies
cannot abide. How answer you that?</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SNOUT</speaker>
<ab>
By &#8217;r lakin, a parlous fear.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STARVELING</speaker>
<ab>
I believe we must leave the killing out,
when all is done.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<ab>
Not a whit! I have a device to make all well.
Write me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to
say we will do no harm with our swords, and that
Pyramus is not killed indeed. And, for the more
better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not
Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver. This will put them
out of fear.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<ab>
Well, we will have such a prologue, and it shall
be written in eight and six.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<ab>
No, make it two more. Let it be written in
eight and eight.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SNOUT</speaker>
<ab>
Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STARVELING</speaker>
<ab>
I fear it, I promise you.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<ab>
Masters, you ought to consider with yourself,
to bring in (God shield us!) a lion among ladies is a
most dreadful thing. For there is not a more fearful
wildfowl than your lion living, and we ought to look
to &#8217;t.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SNOUT</speaker>
<ab>
Therefore another prologue must tell he is not
a lion.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<ab>
Nay, you must name his name, and half his
face must be seen through the lion&#8217;s neck, and he
himself must speak through, saying thus, or to the
same defect: "Ladies," or "Fair ladies, I would
wish you," or "I would request you," or "I would
entreat you not to fear, not to tremble! My life for
yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it were
pity of my life. No, I am no such thing. I am a man as
other men are." And there indeed let him name his
name and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<ab>
Well, it shall be so. But there is two hard
things: that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber,
for you know Pyramus and Thisbe meet by
moonlight.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SNOUT</speaker>
<ab>
Doth the moon shine that night we play our
play?</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<ab>
A calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanac.
Find out moonshine, find out moonshine.</ab>
</sp>
<stage>Quince takes out a book.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<ab>
Yes, it doth shine that night.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<ab>
Why, then, may you leave a casement of the
great chamber window, where we play, open, and
the moon may shine in at the casement.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<ab>
Ay, or else one must come in with a bush of
thorns and a lantern and say he comes to disfigure
or to present the person of Moonshine. Then there
is another thing: we must have a wall in the great
chamber, for Pyramus and Thisbe, says the story,
did talk through the chink of a wall.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>SNOUT</speaker>
<ab>
You can never bring in a wall. What say you,
Bottom?</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<ab>
Some man or other must present Wall. And
let him have some plaster, or some loam, or some
roughcast about him to signify wall, or let him
hold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall
Pyramus and Thisbe whisper.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<ab>
If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down,
every mother&#8217;s son, and rehearse your parts. Pyramus,
you begin. When you have spoken your
speech, enter into that brake, and so everyone
according to his cue.</ab>

<stage>Enter Robin invisible to those onstage.</stage>

<speaker>ROBIN</speaker>

<ab>
<line>What hempen homespuns have we swagg&#8217;ring here</line>
<line>So near the cradle of the Fairy Queen?</line>

Methinks, mistress, you should have little

<stage>Enter Oberon, King of Fairies.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<ab>
<line>I wonder if Titania be awaked;</line>
<line>Then what it was that next came in her eye,</line>
<line>Which she must dote on in extremity.</line>
<stage>Enter Robin Goodfellow.</stage>
<line>Here comes my messenger. How now, mad spirit?</line>
<line>What night-rule now about this haunted grove?</line>

<speaker>ROBIN</speaker>
<ab>
<line>My mistress with a monster is in love.</line>
<line>Near to her close and consecrated bower,</line>
<line>While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,</line>
<line>A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,</line>
<line>That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,</line>
<line>Were met together to rehearse a play</line>
<line>Intended for great Theseus&#8217; nuptial day.</line>
<line>The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,</line>
<line>Who Pyramus presented in their sport,</line>
<line>Forsook his scene and entered in a brake.</line>
<line>When I did him at this advantage take,</line>
<line>An ass&#8217;s noll I fix&#232;d on his head.</line>
<line>Anon his Thisbe must be answer&#232;d,</line>
<line>And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,</line>
<line>As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,</line>
<line>Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,</line>
<line>Rising and cawing at the gun&#8217;s report,</line>
<line>Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,</line>
<line>So at his sight away his fellows fly,</line>
<line>And, at our stamp, here o&#8217;er and o&#8217;er one falls.</line>
<line>He "Murder" cries and help from Athens calls.</line>
<line>Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears thus strong,</line>
<line>Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;</line>
<line>For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch,</line>
<line>Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all things catch.</line>
<line>I led them on in this distracted fear</line>
<line>And left sweet Pyramus translated there.</line>
<line>When in that moment, so it came to pass,</line>
<line>Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.</line>

<speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<ab>
<line>This falls out better than I could devise.</line>

<line>With the love juice, as I did bid thee do?</line>
</ab>

<sp>
<speaker>ROBIN</speaker>
<ab>
<line>I took him sleeping&#8212;that is finished, too&#8212;</line>

<line>O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?</line>
<line>Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe!</line>

<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Now I but chide, but I should use thee worse,</line>
<line>For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse.</line>
<line>If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,</line>
<line>Being o&#8217;er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep</line>
<line>And kill me too.</line>
<line>The sun was not so true unto the day</line>
<line>As he to me. Would he have stolen away</line>
<line>From sleeping Hermia? I&#8217;ll believe as soon</line>
<line>This whole Earth may be bored, and that the moon</line>
<line>May through the center creep and so displease</line>
<line>Her brother&#8217;s noontide with th&#8217; Antipodes.</line>
<line>It cannot be but thou hast murdered him.</line>
<line>So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.</line>

<sp>
<speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>

<line>So should the murdered look, and so should I,</line>

<line>I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.</line>

<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Out, dog! Out, cur! Thou driv&#8217;st me past the bounds</line>
<line>Of maiden&#8217;s patience. Hast thou slain him, then?</line>
<line>Henceforth be never numbered among men.</line>
<line>O, once tell true! Tell true, even for my sake!</line>
<line>Durst thou have looked upon him, being awake?</line>
<line>And hast thou killed him sleeping? O brave touch!</line>
<line>Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?</line>
<line>An adder did it, for with doubler tongue</line>
<line>Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.</line>

<stage>She exits.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<ab>
<line>There is no following her in this fierce vein.</line>
<line>Here, therefore, for a while I will remain.</line>
<line>So sorrow&#8217;s heaviness doth heavier grow</line>
<line>For debt that bankrout sleep doth sorrow owe,</line>
<line>Which now in some slight measure it will pay,</line>

<ab>
<line>What hast thou done? Thou hast mistaken quite</line>

<line>Of thy misprision must perforce ensue</line>
<line>Some true-love turned, and not a false turned true.</line>

</sp>

<line>With sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear.</line>
<line>By some illusion see thou bring her here.</line>

Flower of this purple dye,
Hit with Cupid&#8217;s archery,
Sink in apple of his eye.
When his love he doth espy,
Let her shine as gloriously
As the Venus of the sky.&#8212;
When thou wak&#8217;st, if she be by,
Beg of her for remedy.</ab>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Robin.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>ROBIN</speaker>
<ab>
Captain of our fairy band,
Helena is here at hand,
And the youth, mistook by me,
Pleading for a lover&#8217;s fee.
Shall we their fond pageant see?
Lord, what fools these mortals be!</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<ab>
Stand aside. The noise they make
Will cause Demetrius to awake.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROBIN</speaker>
<ab>
Then will two at once woo one.
That must needs be sport alone.
And those things do best please me
That befall prepost&#8217;rously.</ab>
</sp>
<stage>They step aside.</stage>
<stage>Enter Lysander and Helena.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<ab>
<line>
Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?</line>
<line>
Scorn and derision never come in tears.</line>
<line>
Look when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,</line>
<line>
In their nativity all truth appears.</line>
<line>
How can these things in me seem scorn to you,</line>
<line>
Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true?</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>
You do advance your cunning more and more.</line>
<line>
When truth kills truth, O devilish holy fray!</line>
<line>
These vows are Hermia&#8217;s. Will you give her o&#8217;er?</line>
<line>
Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing
weigh.</line>
<line>
Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,</line>
<line>
Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<ab>
<line>I had no judgment when to her I swore.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o&#8217;er.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<stage>, waking up</stage>
<ab>
<line>O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!</line>
<line>To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?</line>
<line>Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show</line>
<line>Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!</line>
<line>That pure congeal&#232;d white, high Taurus&#8217; snow,</line>
<line>Fanned with the eastern wind, turns to a crow</line>
<line>When thou hold&#8217;st up thy hand. O, let me kiss</line>
<line>This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent</line>
<line>To set against me for your merriment.</line>
<line>If you were civil and knew courtesy,</line>
<line>You would not do me thus much injury.</line>
<line>Can you not hate me, as I know you do,</line>
<line>But you must join in souls to mock me too?</line>
<line>If you were men, as men you are in show,</line>
<line>You would not use a gentle lady so,</line>
<line>To vow and swear and superpraise my parts,</line>
<line>When, I am sure, you hate me with your hearts.</line>
<line>You both are rivals and love Hermia,</line>
<line>And now both rivals to mock Helena.</line>
<line>A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,</line>
<line>To conjure tears up in a poor maid&#8217;s eyes</line>
<line>With your derision! None of noble sort</line>
<line>Would so offend a virgin and extort</line>
<line>A poor soul&#8217;s patience, all to make you sport.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<ab>
<line>You are unkind, Demetrius. Be not so,</line>
<line>For you love Hermia; this you know I know.</line>
<line>And here with all goodwill, with all my heart,</line>
<line>In Hermia&#8217;s love I yield you up my part.</line>
<line>And yours of Helena to me bequeath,</line>
<line>Whom I do love and will do till my death.</line>
</ab>

<ab>
<line>Never did mockers waste more idle breath.</line>

<speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Lysander, keep thy Hermia. I will none.</line>
<line>If e&#8217;er I loved her, all that love is gone.</line>
<line>My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourned,</line>

<stage>Enter Hermia.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<stage>, to Lysander</stage>
<ab>
<line>Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,</line>
<line>The ear more quick of apprehension makes;</line>
<line>Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,</line>
<line>It pays the hearing double recompense.</line>
<line>Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;</line>
<line>Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound.</line>
<line>But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Why should he stay whom love doth press to go?</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>What love could press Lysander from my side?</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Lysander&#8217;s love, that would not let him bide,</line>
<line>Fair Helena, who more engilds the night</line>
<line>Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.</line>
<line>Why seek&#8217;st thou me? Could not this make thee know</line>
<line>The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>You speak not as you think. It cannot be.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Lo, she is one of this confederacy!</line>
<line>Now I perceive they have conjoined all three</line>
<line>To fashion this false sport in spite of me.&#8212;</line>
<line>Injurious Hermia, most ungrateful maid,</line>
<line>Have you conspired, have you with these contrived,</line>
<line>To bait me with this foul derision?</line>
<line>Is all the counsel that we two have shared,</line>
<line>The sisters&#8217; vows, the hours that we have spent</line>
<line>When we have chid the hasty-footed time</line>
<line>For parting us&#8212;O, is all forgot?</line>
<line>All schooldays&#8217; friendship, childhood innocence?</line>
<line>We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,</line>
<line>Have with our needles created both one flower,</line>
<line>Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,</line>
<line>Both warbling of one song, both in one key,</line>
<line>As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds</line>
<line>Had been incorporate. So we grew together</line>
<line>Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,</line>
<line>But yet an union in partition,</line>
<line>Two lovely berries molded on one stem;</line>
<line>So with two seeming bodies but one heart,</line>
<line>Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,</line>
<line>Due but to one, and crown&#232;d with one crest.</line>
<line>And will you rent our ancient love asunder,</line>
<line>To join with men in scorning your poor friend?</line>
<line>It is not friendly; &#8217;tis not maidenly.</line>
<line>Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,</line>
<line>Though I alone do feel the injury.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>I am amaz&#232;d at your words.</line>
<line>I scorn you not. It seems that you scorn me.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,</line>
<line>To follow me and praise my eyes and face,</line>
<line>And made your other love, Demetrius,</line>
<line>Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,</line>
<line>To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,</line>
<line>Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this</line>
<line>To her he hates? And wherefore doth Lysander</line>
<line>Deny your love (so rich within his soul)</line>
<line>And tender me, forsooth, affection,</line>
<line>But by your setting on, by your consent?</line>
<line>What though I be not so in grace as you,</line>
<line>So hung upon with love, so fortunate,</line>
<line>But miserable most, to love unloved?</line>
<line>This you should pity rather than despise.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>I understand not what you mean by this.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>Ay, do. Persever, counterfeit sad looks,</line>
<line>Make mouths upon me when I turn my back,</line>
<line>Wink each at other, hold the sweet jest up.</line>
<line>This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.</line>
<line>If you have any pity, grace, or manners,</line>
<line>You would not make me such an argument.</line>
<line>But fare you well. &#8217;Tis partly my own fault,</line>
<line>Which death or absence soon shall remedy.</line>

<line>Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,</line>

<line>With league whose date till death shall never end.</line>
<line>Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,</line>

From these that my poor company detest.</line>

<line>Her dotage now I do begin to pity.</line>
<line>For, meeting her of late behind the wood,</line>
<line>Seeking sweet favors for this hateful fool,</line>
<line>I did upbraid her and fall out with her.</line>
<line>For she his hairy temples then had rounded</line>
<line>With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;</line>
<line>And that same dew, which sometime on the buds</line>
<line>Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,</line>
<line>Stood now within the pretty flouriets&#8217; eyes,</line>
<line>Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.</line>

<line>Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent</line>
<line>To bear him to my bower in Fairyland.</line>
<line>And now I have the boy, I will undo</line>
<line>This hateful imperfection of her eyes.</line>
<line>And, gentle Puck, take this transform&#232;d scalp</line>
<line>From off the head of this Athenian swain,</line>
<line>That he, awaking when the other do,</line>
<line>May all to Athens back again repair</line>

<speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>
<ab>
<line>I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,</line>
<line>When in a wood of Crete they bayed the bear</line>
<line>With hounds of Sparta. Never did I hear</line>
<line>Such gallant chiding, for, besides the groves,</line>
<line>The skies, the fountains, every region near</line>
<line>Seemed all one mutual cry. I never heard</line>

<line>Crook-kneed, and dewlapped like Thessalian bulls;</line>
<line>Slow in pursuit, but matched in mouth like bells,</line>
<line>Each under each. A cry more tunable</line>
<line>Was never holloed to, nor cheered with horn,</line>
<line>In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly.</line>
<line>Judge when you hear.&#8212;But soft! What nymphs are these?</line>

<speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<ab>
<line>No doubt they rose up early to observe</line>
<line>The rite of May, and hearing our intent,</line>
<line>Came here in grace of our solemnity.</line>

<line>But, as I think&#8212;for truly would I speak,</line>

<line>I came with Hermia hither. Our intent</line>

When my cue comes, call me,

Hey-ho! Peter Quince! Flute the bellows-mender!
Snout the tinker! Starveling! God&#8217;s my life! Stolen
hence and left me asleep! I have had a most rare
vision. I have had a dream past the wit of man to say
what dream it was. Man is but an ass if he go about
to expound this dream. Methought I was&#8212;there
is no man can tell what. Methought I was and
methought I had&#8212;but man is but a patched fool if
he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of
man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen,
man&#8217;s hand is not able to taste, his tongue to
conceive, nor his heart to report what my dream
was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this
dream. It shall be called <title rend="quotes">Bottom&#8217;s Dream</title> because
it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the
latter end of a play, before the Duke. Peradventure,
to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her
death.</ab>

It is not possible. You have not a man in all

No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraftman

<ab>
O, sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost six
pence a day during his life. He could not have
&#8217;scaped six pence a day. An the Duke had not given
him six pence a day for playing Pyramus, I&#8217;ll be
hanged. He would have deserved it. Six pence a day

Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is that
the Duke hath dined. Get your apparel together,
good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your
pumps. Meet presently at the palace. Every man
look o&#8217;er his part. For the short and the long is, our
play is preferred. In any case, let Thisbe have clean
linen, and let not him that plays the lion pare his
nails, for they shall hang out for the lion&#8217;s claws.
And, most dear actors, eat no onions nor garlic, for
we are to utter sweet breath, and I do not doubt but
to hear them say it is a sweet comedy. No more

<ab>
<line>&#8217;Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<ab>
<line>More strange than true. I never may believe</line>
<line>These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.</line>
<line>Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,</line>
<line>Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend</line>
<line>More than cool reason ever comprehends.</line>
<line>The lunatic, the lover, and the poet</line>
<line>Are of imagination all compact.</line>
<line>One sees more devils than vast hell can hold:</line>
<line>That is the madman. The lover, all as frantic,</line>
<line>Sees Helen&#8217;s beauty in a brow of Egypt.</line>
<line>The poet&#8217;s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,</line>
<line>Doth glance from heaven to Earth, from Earth to heaven,</line>
<line>And as imagination bodies forth</line>
<line>The forms of things unknown, the poet&#8217;s pen</line>
<line>Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing</line>
<line>A local habitation and a name.</line>
<line>Such tricks hath strong imagination</line>
<line>That, if it would but apprehend some joy,</line>
<line>It comprehends some bringer of that joy.</line>

<line>How easy is a bush supposed a bear!</line>

Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show.</line>

But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.</line>
<line>
This man is Pyramus, if you would know.</line>
<line>
This beauteous lady Thisbe is certain.</line>
<line>
This man with lime and roughcast doth present</line>
<line>
"Wall," that vile wall which did these lovers
sunder;</line>
<line>
And through Wall&#8217;s chink, poor souls, they are
content</line>
<line>
To whisper, at the which let no man wonder.</line>
<line>
This man, with lantern, dog, and bush of thorn,</line>
<line>
Presenteth "Moonshine," for, if you will know,</line>
<line>
By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn</line>
<line>
To meet at Ninus&#8217; tomb, there, there to woo.</line>
<line>
This grisly beast (which "Lion" hight by name)</line>
<line>
The trusty Thisbe coming first by night</line>
<line>
Did scare away, or rather did affright;</line>
<line>
And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,</line>
<line>
Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.</line>
<line>
Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,</line>
<line>
And finds his trusty Thisbe&#8217;s mantle slain.</line>
<line>
Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,</line>
<line>
He bravely broached his boiling bloody breast.</line>
<line>
And Thisbe, tarrying in mulberry shade,</line>
<line>
His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,</line>

Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain</line>

<line>Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe,</line>
<line>Did whisper often, very secretly.</line>
<line>This loam, this roughcast, and this stone doth show</line>

No, in truth, sir, he should not. "Deceiving

Now is the wall down between the two
neighbors.</ab>

<speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<ab>
No remedy, my lord, when walls are so
willful to hear without warning.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>
<ab>
This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<ab>
The best in this kind are but shadows, and
the worst are no worse, if imagination amend
them.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>
<ab>
It must be your imagination, then, and not
theirs.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<ab>
If we imagine no worse of them than they of
themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here
come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.</ab>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Lion (Snug) and Moonshine (Starveling).</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>SNUG</speaker>
<stage>, as Lion</stage>
<ab>
<line>
You ladies, you whose gentle hearts do fear</line>
<line>
The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on
floor,</line>
<line>
May now perchance both quake and tremble here,</line>
<line>
When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.</line>
<line>
Then know that I, as Snug the joiner, am</line>
<line>
A lion fell, nor else no lion&#8217;s dam;</line>
<line>
For if I should as lion come in strife</line>
<line>
Into this place, &#8217;twere pity on my life.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<ab>
A very gentle beast, and of a good
conscience.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<ab>
The very best at a beast, my lord, that e&#8217;er I
saw.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<ab>
This lion is a very fox for his valor.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<ab>
True, and a goose for his discretion.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<ab>
Not so, my lord, for his valor cannot carry
his discretion, and the fox carries the goose.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<ab>
His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his
valor, for the goose carries not the fox. It is well.
Leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the
Moon.</ab>

<ab>
<line>This lanthorn doth the horn&#232;d moon present.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<ab>
He should have worn the horns on his
head.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<ab>
He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible
within the circumference.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STARVELING</speaker>
<stage>, as Moonshine</stage>
<ab>
<line>
This lanthorn doth the horn&#232;d moon present.</line>
<line>
Myself the man i&#8217; th&#8217; moon do seem to be.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<ab>
This is the greatest error of all the rest; the
man should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else
"the man i&#8217; th&#8217; moon"?</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<ab>
He dares not come there for the candle,
for you see, it is already in snuff.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>
<ab>
I am aweary of this moon. Would he would
change.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<ab>
It appears by his small light of discretion that
he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all reason,
we must stay the time.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<ab>
Proceed, Moon.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>STARVELING</speaker>
<stage>, as Moonshine</stage>
<ab>
All that I have to say is to tell
you that the lanthorn is the moon, I the man i&#8217; th&#8217;
moon, this thornbush my thornbush, and this dog
my dog.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<ab>
Why, all these should be in the lanthorn,
for all these are in the moon. But silence. Here
comes Thisbe.</ab>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Thisbe (Flute).</stage>

<line>This is old Ninny&#8217;s tomb. Where is my love?</line>

<ab>
O!</ab>
</sp>
<stage>The Lion roars. Thisbe runs off, dropping her mantle.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<ab>
Well roared, Lion.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<ab>
Well run, Thisbe.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>
<ab>
Well shone, Moon. Truly, the Moon shines
with a good grace.</ab>
</sp>
<stage>Lion worries the mantle.</stage>
<sp>

<ab>
Well moused, Lion.</ab>

Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams.</line>
<line>
I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright,</line>
<line>
For by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,</line>
<line>
I trust to take of truest Thisbe sight.&#8212;</line>
<line>
But stay! O spite!</line>
<line>
But mark, poor knight,</line>
<line>
What dreadful dole is here!</line>
<line>
Eyes, do you see!</line>
<line>
How can it be!</line>
<line>
O dainty duck! O dear!</line>
<line>
Thy mantle good&#8212;</line>
<line>
What, stained with blood?</line>
<line>
Approach, ye Furies fell!</line>
<line>
O Fates, come, come,</line>
<line>
Cut thread and thrum,</line>
<line>
Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<ab>
This passion, and the death of a dear friend,
would go near to make a man look sad.</ab>

Beshrew my heart but I pity the man.</ab>

Come, tears, confound!</line>

Out, sword, and wound</line>

No die, but an ace<anchor/>

</app> for him, for he is but
one.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<ab>
Less than an ace, man, for he is dead, he is
nothing.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<ab>
With the help of a surgeon he might yet
recover and yet prove an ass.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>
<ab>
How chance Moonshine is gone before
Thisbe comes back and finds her lover?</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<ab>
She will find him by starlight.
<stage>Enter Thisbe (Flute).</stage>
Here she comes, and her passion ends the play.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>
<ab>
Methinks she should not use a long one for
such a Pyramus. I hope she will be brief.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<ab>
A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus,
which Thisbe, is the better: he for a man, God
warrant us; she for a woman, God bless us.</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<ab>
She hath spied him already with those
sweet eyes.</ab>

<ab>
<line>
Asleep, my love?</line>
<line>
What, dead, my dove?</line>
<line>
O Pyramus, arise!</line>
<line>
Speak, speak. Quite dumb?</line>
<line>
Dead? Dead? A tomb</line>
<line>
Must cover thy sweet eyes.</line>
<line>
These lily lips,</line>
<line>
This cherry nose,</line>
<line>
These yellow cowslip cheeks</line>
<line>
Are gone, are gone!</line>
<line>
Lovers, make moan;</line>
<line>
His eyes were green as leeks.</line>
<line>
O Sisters Three,</line>
<line>
Come, come to me</line>
<line>
With hands as pale as milk.</line>
<line>
Lay them in gore,</line>
<line>
Since you have shore</line>
<line>
With shears his thread of silk.</line>
<line>
Tongue, not a word!</line>
<line>
Come, trusty sword,</line>
<line>
Come, blade, my breast imbrue!</line>
<stage>Thisbe stabs herself.</stage>

And farewell, friends.</line>

Thus Thisbe ends.</line>

Adieu, adieu, adieu.</line>

Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the
dead.</ab>

<ab>
Ay, and Wall too.</ab>
</sp>
<stage>Bottom and Flute arise.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<ab>
No, I assure you, the wall is down that
parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the
Epilogue or to hear a Bergomask dance between
two of our company?</ab>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<ab>
No epilogue, I pray you. For your play needs
no excuse. Never excuse. For when the players are
all dead, there need none to be blamed. Marry, if
he that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged
himself in Thisbe&#8217;s garter, it would have been a fine
tragedy; and so it is, truly, and very notably discharged.
But, come, your Bergomask. Let your
epilogue alone.
<stage>Dance, and the players exit.</stage>
<line>The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve.</line>
<line>Lovers, to bed! &#8217;Tis almost fairy time.</line>
<line>I fear we shall outsleep the coming morn</line>
<line>As much as we this night have overwatched.</line>
<line>This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled</line>
<line>The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.</line>

Now the hungry lion roars,</line>

And the wolf behowls the moon,</line>
<line>
Whilst the heavy plowman snores,</line>
<line>
All with weary task fordone.</line>
<line>
Now the wasted brands do glow,</line>
<line>
Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,</line>
<line>
Puts the wretch that lies in woe</line>
<line>
In remembrance of a shroud.</line>
<line>
Now it is the time of night</line>
<line>
That the graves, all gaping wide,</line>
<line>
Every one lets forth his sprite</line>
<line>
In the church-way paths to glide.</line>
<line>
And we fairies, that do run</line>
<line>
By the triple Hecate&#8217;s team</line>
<line>
From the presence of the sun,</line>
<line>
Following darkness like a dream,</line>
<line>
Now are frolic. Not a mouse</line>
<line>
Shall disturb this hallowed house.</line>
<line>
I am sent with broom before,</line>
<line>
To sweep the dust behind the door.</line>
</ab>
</sp>
<stage>Enter Oberon and Titania, King and Queen of Fairies,
with all their train.</stage>

Hop as light as bird from brier,</line>

To the best bride-bed will we,</line>
<line>
Which by us shall bless&#232;d be,</line>
<line>
And the issue there create</line>
<line>
Ever shall be fortunate.</line>
<line>
So shall all the couples three</line>
<line>
Ever true in loving be,</line>
<line>
And the blots of Nature&#8217;s hand</line>
<line>
Shall not in their issue stand.</line>
<line>
Never mole, harelip, nor scar,</line>
<line>
Nor mark prodigious, such as are</line>
<line>
Despis&#232;d in nativity,</line>
<line>
Shall upon their children be.</line>
<line>
With this field-dew consecrate</line>
<line>
Every fairy take his gait,</line>
<line>
And each several chamber bless,</line>
<line>
Through this palace, with sweet peace.</line>
<line>
And the owner of it blest,</line>
<line>
Ever shall in safety rest.</line>
<line>
Trip away. Make no stay.</line>
<line>
Meet me all by break of day.</line>

If we shadows have offended,</line>

Think but this and all is mended:</line>

<line>
While these visions did appear.</line>
<line>
And this weak and idle theme,</line>
<line>
No more yielding but a dream,</line>
<line>
Gentles, do not reprehend.</line>

If you pardon, we will mend.</line>

Now to &#8217;scape the serpent&#8217;s tongue,</line>
